    # actually using our site!

    # this verifies that after the link is clicked we land on the
    # path that we are expecting
    expect(current_path).to eq(lists_path)

    # now this is just amazing...here were going to fill in our form fields
    # with real data
    fill_in "list_name", with: "Some task name"

    # and now we click the submit button, well..not us...but our computer lackey
    click_button "Create List"

    # this will verify that there is an elemnt with class 'l-name'
    # that has the text we just saved for a name. In other words it will check
    # the newly listed out lists to see if it really got saved, it does this by looking
    # for the list on the actual page...pretty cool stuff
